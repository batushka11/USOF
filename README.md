## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **MySQL**: [Download and install MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- **NPM**: [Download and install NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/batushka11/USOF.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**:

   ```bash
   cd USOF
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**: An .env.example file is provided with all the required environment variables. Create a .env file by copying .env.example and then fill in the necessary values.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**: Install all necessary dependencies for the project by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Generate Prisma Client**: Prisma is used for database management. Generate the Prisma client to interact with your MySQL database:

   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

6. **Create the Database**: Use Prisma to create the initial database schema:

   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   ```

7. **Migrate the Database**: Apply database migrations to ensure your MySQL database schema matches the project structure:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

8. **Seed the Database**: Populate the database with initial data by running:

   ```bash
   npx run seed
   ```
